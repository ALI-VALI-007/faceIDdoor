This will use a raspberry pi with two motors, one for locking and one for opening the door.
add faces as you wish in the APPROVEDFACES file. Name them numbers starting from 0.
It will open the door and then close the door after the allotted time.

I used motors but I actually recommend using pistons for the locking
Cut a hole out in the top of your door (or another side)
This will act as a deadbolt, i reacommend putting it high since if its not secured properly someone can swipe a card and unlock our door
